Python Windows Service Manager is a python package that helps to easily manage
windows services, mirroring the functionality of the Windows Service
Controller Utility (sc.exe). It allows to easily manage both Driver and Win32
services. The following can be achieved using this package:

 * Create, Remove, or Update a service configuration
 * Query a specific or all Service Statuses
 * Get a service configuration
 * Verify a service exists
 * Start, Stop, Pause, Continue, Interrogate a service

==============
Pre-requisites
==============
    pypiwin32>=219

============
Installation
============
 * Clone this repository
 * Put the repo dir in your PYTHONPATH
 * Run:

.. code:: python

    python setup.py install

=====================
How to Run Unit Tests
=====================
1.  pip install mock, nose, nose_parameterized
2.  From the module's root directory, run 'nosetests .'

======================
How to Run the Example
======================
1.  Download the package
2.  From the module's root directory, run 'python example.py'

  * **Note**: Due to the way Windows Services work, you need to
    have the powershell scipt, testService.ps1, in the same
    directory as the example.py

=====
Usage
=====
This module attempts to follow the ORM design Pattern, where the Class
WindowsServiceConfigurationManager would be your context, and object that
represents the data store is a ServiceEntity.

WindowsServiceConfigurationManager
----------------------------------
This is the entry point for all operations. This module has static methods that:
- Creates or Gets a Service, and returns a Entity object that represents that service
- Query All Service Statuses
- Verify a service exists
- Gets a specific service's status

The following Describes these operations in detail:

    # Note that the Create Service Method just creates the entity in memeory.
    # To save it to the 'DataStore', you must call Save()
    myService.Save(password)


* **Delete a Service:**

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService
    serviceName = "TestService"
    myService = GetService(serviceName)

    # Note that the GetService Method reads for the data store and creates the entity in memeory.
    # To delete it from the 'DataStore', you must call Delete()
    myService.Delete()


* **Query All Services Statuses**:
  Returns a list of each installed service's status. (Please see status definition below for more details)

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import QueryAllServicesStatus

    statuses = QueryAllServicesStatus()
    print statuses

* **Service Exists**:

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import ServiceExists

    serviceName = 'TestService'
    serviceExists = ServiceExists(serviceName)
    print serviceExists



* **Get Service Status**:
  Returns a single service's status (Please see status definition below for more details)

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetServiceStatus
    serviceName = 'TestService'
    serviceStatus = GetServiceStatus(serviceName)
    print serviceStatus

ServiceEntity
-------------
This is the object that maps to the service.

The object contains the following commands for each service:
  * Save
  * Delete
  * Start
  * Stop
  * Pause
  * Continue
  * Interrogate
  * GetServiceStatus
  * UpdateConfiguration
  * Exists

You need to make sure that the commands Pause, Continue, and Interrogate are
able to be excepted by the service. The accepted commands are dependent on 2
things. First, if the service is configurated to accept such commands, and
second, if the current state of the service allows that command to be called on
the service. The code examples below shows how to deal with this. Furthermore,
if a service is not in a "Running" state, than Stop cannot be called.
Vis-a-versa, if a service is not in a "Stopped" state, then Start cannot be
called.

* **UpdateConfiguration**: Used to update a service's configuration in memeory.
  You must call the save method to persist the service.

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

    serviceName = 'TestService'
    myService = GetService(serviceName)
    myService.UpdateConfiguration('StartType', 'DEMAND_START')
    myService.Save()


* **Save**: Saves the current state of the ServiceEntity as a service in the OS.
  You can pass a password as an argument to this function if one is needed, the
  default value is 'None'

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

    serviceName = 'TestService'
    myService = GetService(serviceName)
    myService.UpdateConfiguration('ServiceStartName', 'MyDomain\\MyNewUser')
    myService.Save('MyNewPassword')


* **Delete**: Deletes the Service
  Deletes a service. Please note that you if your service is running, you will
  need to stop the service for it to be deleted. Also, if anything has a handle
  open to the service, those need to be closed as well. If Delete() is called
  on service in which a handle is open, then it will be 'Marked for Deletion'
  and will not be deleted until all handles are closed.

.. code:: python

   from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

   serviceName = 'TestService'
   myService = GetService(serviceName)
   myService.Delete()


* **Start**: Deletes the Service
  Starts a given service that has is stopped. If the service is running, the
  function will just return. Also, if the service does not return from the Start
  command within 30 seconds, a TimeoutException is thrown

.. code:: python

   from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

   serviceName = 'TestService'
   myService = WindowsServiceConfigurationManager.GetService(serviceName)
   myService.Start()


* **Stop**: Stops the Service
  Stops a given service that is started. If the service is stopped, the function
  will just return. Also, if the service does not return from the Stop
  command within 30 seconds, a TimeoutException is thrown

.. code:: python

   from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

   serviceName = 'TestService'
   myService = WindowsServiceConfigurationManager.GetService(serviceName)
   myService.Stop()

* **Restart**: Restart the Service
  Restarts a given service that is started. If the service is stopped, this is
  equivelent to just calling start. If the service is running, then service will
  be stopped and then started. Also, if the service does not return from the
  Stop or Start command within 30 seconds, a TimeoutException is thrown

.. code:: python

   from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

   serviceName = 'TestService'
   myService = WindowsServiceConfigurationManager.GetService(serviceName)
   myService.Restart()

* **Continue**: Continues the Service after it was paused
  Stops a given service that is Paused and/or has the value
  ACCEPT_PAUSE_CONTINUE in ControlsAccepted. If not, an exception will be
  thrown. Also, if the service does not return from the Continue command
  within 30 seconds, a TimeoutException is thrown

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

    serviceName = 'TestService'
    myService = GetService(serviceName)
    status = myService.GetServiceStatus()
    if 'ACCEPT_PAUSE_CONTINUE' in status['ControlsAccepted']:
        myService.Continue()


* **Pause**: Pauses the Service
  Pauses a given service that is Paused and/or has the value
  ACCEPT_PAUSE_CONTINUE in ControlsAccepted. If not, an exception will be
  thrown. Also, if the service does not return from the Pause command within
  30 seconds, a TimeoutException is thrown

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

    serviceName = 'TestService'
    myService = GetService(serviceName)
    myServiceStatus = myService.GetServiceStatus().Status
    if 'ACCEPT_PAUSE_CONTINUE' in status['ControlsAccepted']:
        myService.Pause()


* **Interrogate**: Interrogates the Service

.. code:: python

    from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

    serviceName = 'TestService'
    myService = GetService(serviceName)
    myService.Interrogate()


* **GetServiceStatus**: Deletes the Service
  Returns a the service's status
  (Please see status definition below for more details)

.. code:: python

   from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import GetService

   serviceName = 'TestService'
   myService = WindowsServiceConfigurationManager.GetService(serviceName)
   status = myService.GetServiceStatus()
   print status


* **Exists**: Deletes the Service
  Returns if the service exists

.. code:: python

   from pywinservicemanager.WindowsServiceConfigurationManager import Exists

   serviceName = 'TestService'
   myService = WindowsServiceConfigurationManager.GetService(serviceName)
   print myService.Exists()



FailureActionConfigurationType
------------------------------
Represents the action the service controller should take on each failure of a
service. A service is considered failed when it terminates without reporting a
status of SERVICE_STOPPED to the service controller

The constructor of this object takes the following parameters:
  1. *failureActionsTypeList*: List of FailureActionType Objects
      - Valid Value: List of FailureActionType Objects (see below)
      - Default:Value None
  2. *resetPeriodType*: The time after which to reset the failure count to zero if there are no failures, in seconds
      - Valid Value: int or ResetPeriodType(see below)
      - Default:Value None
  3. *rebootMessageType*: The message to be broadcast to server users before rebooting in response to the SC_ACTION_REBOOT service controller action
      - Valid Value: string or RebootMessageType (see below)
      - Default:Value None
  4. *commandLineType*: The command line of the process for the CreateProcess function to execute in response to the SC_ACTION_RUN_COMMAND service controller action. This process runs under the same account as the service.
      - Valid Value: string or CommandLineType (see below)
      - Default:Value None


Example:

.. code:: python

    import pywinservicemanager.ConfigurationTypes as ConfigurationTypes

    failureActionList = []
    delay = 1000

    failureActionList.append(ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateRestartAction(delay))
    failureActionList.append(ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateRunCommandAction(delay))
    resetPeriod = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationResetPeriodType(1)
    rebootMsg = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationRebootMessageType('MyRebootMessage')
    commandLine = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationCommandLineType('MyCommandLineCommand')

    failureActions = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationType(failureActionList, resetPeriod, rebootMsg, commandLine)

    #or
    failureActionList = []
    delay = 1000

    failureActionList.append(ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateRestartAction(delay))
    failureActionList.append(ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateRunCommandAction(delay))

    resetPeriod = 1
    rebootMsg = 'MyRebootMessage'
    commandLine = 'MyCommandLine'

    failureActions = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationType(failureActionList, resetPeriod, rebootMsg, commandLine)

<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685939(v=VS.85).aspx>`_.


FailureActionType
-----------------
Represents an action that the service control manager can perform.

A FailureAction type can be reurned by the factory object FailureActionTypeFactory, where there are 4 methods defined and an int which represents the delaly as the input parameter:
  1. Factory Methods:
      - FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateNoAction(delay): No action.
      - FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateRestartAction(delay): Restart the service.
      - FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateRebootAction(delay): Reboot the computer. If the service uses the reboot action, the caller must have the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME `privilege <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa379306(v=vs.85).aspx>`_. For more information, see `Running with Special Privileges <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms717802(v=vs.85).aspx>`_.
      - FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateRunCommandAction(delay):  Run a command.
  2. delay: The time to wait before performing the specified action, in milliseconds.

Example:

.. code:: python

    import pywinservicemanager.ConfigurationTypes as ConfigurationTypes
    myAction = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionTypeFactory.CreateRestartAction(300)

`More information about FailureAction
<https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms685126(v=vs.85).aspx>`_.


ResetPeriodType
---------------
The time after which to reset the failure count to zero if there are no failures, in seconds.
The input is of time int

Example:

.. code:: python

    import pywinservicemanager.ConfigurationTypes as ConfigurationTypes
    resetPeriod = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationResetPeriodType(1)


FailureActionConfigurationRebootMessageType
-------------------------------------------
The message to be broadcast to server users before rebooting in response to the SC_ACTION_REBOOT service controller action.
If this value is None, the reboot message is unchanged. If the value is an empty string (""), the reboot message is deleted and no message is broadcast.

Example:

.. code:: python

    import pywinservicemanager.ConfigurationTypes as ConfigurationTypes
    rebootMessage = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationRebootMessageType("My Reboot Message")


FailureActionConfigurationRebootMessageType
-------------------------------------------
The message to be broadcast to server users before rebooting in response to the SC_ACTION_REBOOT service controller action.
If this value is None, the reboot message is unchanged. If the value is an empty string (""), the reboot message is deleted and no message is broadcast.

Example:

.. code:: python

    import pywinservicemanager.ConfigurationTypes as ConfigurationTypes
    rebootMessage = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationRebootMessageType("My Reboot Message")


FailureActionConfigurationRebootMessageType
-------------------------------------------
The command line of the process for the CreateProcess function to execute in response to the SC_ACTION_RUN_COMMAND service controller action. This process runs under the same account as the service.
If this value is None, the command is unchanged. If the value is an empty string (""), the command is deleted and no program is run when the service fails.

Example:

.. code:: python

    import pywinservicemanager.ConfigurationTypes as ConfigurationTypes
    commandLine = ConfigurationTypes.FailureActionConfigurationCommandLineType("myCmd.exe")
